> Tombstone bugs & idea:
- have shift plant be a small roll forward leaving the tomb behind

> Grav archer bugs & ideas:
/- boomerange should return to first hit location after all hits
- shift should prioritize enmies infro of you and roughly the closest

> Demon hammer bugs & ideas:
- make aoe version of RMB bigger

> swapping should break movement impairs like knockup
